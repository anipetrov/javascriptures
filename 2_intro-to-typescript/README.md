## Intro to TypeScript

```
$ cd 2_intro-to-typescript
$ npm install
```

Please absolutely do use [the VSCode editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for this session, as it comes
preconfigured for the best possible TypeScript experience. (There are keymap extensions available for many editors, such as VI, Sublime. I’ve gone ahead and added some of those to the ‘recommended extensions’ for this project.)

Don’t read `exercises.md` just yet.
